# Upgradeable ERC20 Smart contract

This is a hardhat project that implements an upgradeable ERC20 Smart contract using the OpenZeppelin library.


Update at 24/5/2022-
The contracts have been implemented, but the test is not working correctly. Need to look at ethers Documentation to get parseEther() function working correctly.
